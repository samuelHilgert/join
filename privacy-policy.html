            <h5>Controller:</h5>
            <p>Join Group-167 is operated by Samuel Hilgert, Oliver Drexler and Rio Stenger.</p>
        
            <h5>Types of data processed:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>No personally identifiable information is processed on Join Group 167. However, non-personal data such as website
                    usage statistics, browser information, IP addresses, and demographic data may be collected for analytical purposes.
                    These insights help us understand user behavior, enhance user experience, and tailor our website content to better
                    meet the needs of our users.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h5>Purposes of processing:</h5>
            <p>The Join Group 167 website is operated solely for educational purposes as part of a programming project. In addition to
                programming tasks, the website also serves to acquire and demonstrate practical skills in web design, user experience,
                and technical implementation. Furthermore, it aims to serve as a digital showcase to present our skills and experiences
                to potential employers, thereby improving our professional prospects.</p>
        
            <h5>Disclosure of data to third parties:</h5>
            <p>We do not disclose personally identifiable information to third parties unless required by law or as part of an
                application process. However, non-personal data may be shared with third-party analytics tools and service providers to
                assist us in improving our website and services. All third-party providers are contractually obligated to maintain the
                confidentiality and security of your data.</p>
        
            <h5>Retention period:</h5>
            <p>Personally identifiable data is neither collected nor stored on Join Group 167. Non-personal data such as website usage
                statistics and analytical results are retained for approximately one year to track trends, evaluate the performance of
                our website, and enhance user experience. After this period, the data is anonymized or deleted.</p>
        
            <h5>User rights:</h5>
            <p>Since no personally identifiable data is processed, there are no specific rights of data subjects regarding their data.
                However, we respect users' rights to privacy and data protection and strive to be transparent about our data processing
                practices and to respond appropriately to requests for information, correction, or deletion of non-personal data.</p>
        
            <h5>Withdrawal of consent:</h5>
            <p>Since consent is not required to process personally identifiable data, withdrawal is not relevant. However, if you do not
                want non-personal data to be collected about you, you can prevent this by disabling cookies or adjusting your browser
                settings. Please note that this may affect the functionality of our website.</p>
        
            <h5>Right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority:</h5>
            <p>Since no personally identifiable data is processed, there is no competent data protection authority or right to lodge a
                complaint. However, we take complaints and concerns regarding our privacy practices seriously and endeavor to address
                them promptly and transparently to maintain the trust of our users.</p>
        
            <h5>Data security:</h5>
            <p>We take the protection of your data seriously and have implemented technical and organizational measures to ensure the
                security and confidentiality of your data. These measures include encryption, firewalls, access controls, regular
                security audits, and employee training on privacy and data security. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee absolute
                security and therefore recommend taking appropriate precautions and informing us of any security concerns.</p>
        
            <h5>Changes to the privacy policy:</h5>
            <p>Changes to this privacy policy will be communicated to users through a notice on our website. It is recommended to
                regularly review this privacy policy to stay informed about updates or changes. Continued use of Join Group 167 after
                the publication of modifications constitutes acceptance of these changes.</p>
