        other things, IP addresses, contact requests, meta and communication
        data, contract data, contact details, names, website access, and other
        data generated via a website.

        External hosting is carried out for the purpose of fulfilling our
        contract with potential and existing customers (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b
        GDPR) and in the interest of a secure, fast, and efficient provision of
        our online offer by a professional provider (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f

        carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and ยง
        25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies
        or access to information on the user's device (e.g., device
        fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. The consent can be
        revoked at any time.

      <h3>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h3>
      <h4>Data Protection</h4>
      <p>
        The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
        very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in
        accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data
        protection declaration.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal
        data is data with which you can be personally identified. This data
        protection declaration explains which data we collect and for what

      </p>
      <p>
        We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g.,
        communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection
        of data against access by third parties is not possible.
      </p>
      <h4>Note on the Responsible Party</h4>

        purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a
        legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
        processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally
        permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or
        commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will
        take place after these reasons no longer apply.
      </p>
      <h4>
        General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this
        Website
      </h4>
      <p>
        If you have given your consent to the processing of your personal data,
        we will process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a
        GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data
        pursuant to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR are processed. In the event of explicit
        consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data
        processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a
        GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to
        information on your terminal device (e.g., via device fingerprinting),
        processing is also carried out on the basis of ยง 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The
        consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the
        fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual
        measures, we will process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
        b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to
        fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data
        processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate
        interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The respective legal
        basis for data processing in individual cases is further explained in
        the following sections of this data protection declaration.
      </p>
      <h4>Recipients of Personal Data</h4>
      <p>
        In some cases, we transfer personal data to external entities
        (processors) or third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        External entities are companies or persons that we involve in data
        processing. Third parties are recipients of data, i.e., recipients of
        personal data. External entities and third parties may receive personal
        data if this is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations, if we
        are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax
        authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure
        pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, or if another legal basis
        permits the data transfer. We only disclose personal data to processors
        if this is based on a valid contract for order processing. In the case
        of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.
      </p>
      <h4>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h4>
      <p>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
        consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The
        legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation
        remains unaffected by the revocation.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct
        Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
      </h4>
      <p>
        If data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you have
        the right at any time to object to the processing of your personal data
        for reasons arising from your particular situation, including profiling
        based on these provisions. If your personal data is processed for the
        purpose of direct advertising, you have the right to object at any time
        to the processing of your affected personal data for the purposes of
        such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is
        related to such direct advertising.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority
      </h4>
      <p>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to
        lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the
        member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the
        alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without
        prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
      </p>
      <h4>Right to Data Portability</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
        basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you
        or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request
        the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will
        only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.
      </p>
      <h4>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h4>
      <p>
        Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right
        to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and
        recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a
        right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose and for
        any further questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any
        time.
      </p>
      <h4>Right to Restriction of Processing</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The
        right to restrict processing exists in certain cases, such as when you
        dispute the accuracy of your personal data, if the processing of your
        personal data was/is unlawful, if we no longer need your personal data
        but you need it for legal claims, or if you have lodged an objection to
        the processing of your personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data
        may only be processed with your consent, for the assertion, exercise, or
        defense of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another
        natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of
        the European Union or a member state.
